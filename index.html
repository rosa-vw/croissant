      A croissant is a French pastry in a crescent shape made from a laminated
      yeast dough similar to puff pastry.
      <br />
      It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br />
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was
      developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the
      brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      <br />
      In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but
      unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
      unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
      was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, around
      35% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked
      from frozen dough.
      <br />
      Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
      countries.
